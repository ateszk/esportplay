WordPress Custom Login Page Template Plugin customizes the default WordPress login page with different templates, logo and background uploads as well support for custom CSS.

== Description ==

WordPress Custom Login Page Template plugin [customizes the default WordPress login page](https://www.cozmoslabs.com/177656-custom-wordpress-login-form/) with different templates, logo and background uploads as well support for custom CSS.

When making changes directly in the WordPress Customizer you can experiment on the fly with adding color to your WordPress login page. Use your own website logo, a beautiful background image and chose between 5 custom login page templates (with more to come).

Each template is custom designed so you get a beautiful login UI without having to spend time modifying each small color, shadow or font. And when you need more control over the interface, adding custom CSS is simple and offers full control over the look and feel, without going through hundreds of settings and color pickers.

If you want to setup your own custom front-end login, registration and user profile forms (and not use the default WordPress ones) you can use [Profile Builder](https://www.cozmoslabs.com/wordpress-profile-builder/).
